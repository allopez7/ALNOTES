Vim Notes
There are three modes in vim, but we will only use 2 modes:
Insert Mode:
o puts you on the next line in insert o puts in previous line and creates a new line
s deletes what is under the cursor and puts it in insert mode at cursor
I will take you to the beginning of the line with the cursor on insert mode
i will create insert mode wherever you are located
a move the cursor to the next character
A moves cursor to the right side and inserts cursor

$ will move the cursor to the end of the line
